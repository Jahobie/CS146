# Inverting a Binary Tree

## Problem Statement
Given the root of a binary tree, invert the tree, and return its root.

## Approach
To solve this problem, we can use a recursive approach. At each node, we swap its left and right children, and then recursively call the same function on its left and right subtrees.
