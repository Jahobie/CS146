## Python Approach


1. **Create Counters for the Strings**: Use `collections.Counter` to count the occurrences of each character in the input strings `s` and `t`.
2. **Compare the Counters**: Check if the counters for `s` and `t` are equal. If equal, return `True`, indicating that the strings are anagrams.


## Java Approach


1. **Create Frequency Map**: Use a `HashMap` to store the frequency of characters in string `s`.
2. **Update Frequency Map**: Iterate through string `t` and update the frequency map accordingly.
3. **Check for Anagram**: If the frequency map is empty after iterating through `t`, return `true`, indicating that `s` and `t` are anagrams.
