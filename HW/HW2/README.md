## Approach

The problem can be solved efficiently using binary search. The key idea is to divide the search space in half at each step by checking the middle version. If the middle version is a bad version, then all versions after it are also bad. Hence, we update the right pointer to the middle version and continue searching in the left half. If the middle version is not a bad version, then we update the left pointer to the middle version plus one and continue searching in the right half.

This approach ensures that we minimize the number of calls to the `isBadVersion()` function by halving the search space in each step.
