# Time Complexity Analysis

## Problem 1: Insertion Sort

### Algorithm Description
Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that builds the final sorted array one item at a time. It iterates through an array, growing the sorted array behind it.

### Time Complexity
- **Best Case:** O(n) - When the array is already sorted, it only requires a single pass through the array.
- **Average Case:** O(n^2) - On average, each element must be compared with every other element in the array.
- **Worst Case:** O(n^2) - When the array is in reverse order, each element must be moved to the beginning of the array.
